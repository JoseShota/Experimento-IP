<h1>Topic and Response Distribution</h1>

{% if is_practice %}
  <p class="mb-3"><strong>Practice round</strong></p>
{% else %}
  <p class="mb-3">You are now in <strong>Round {{ player.round_number }} of {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }}</strong>.</p>
{% endif %}
<p>Over the next three screens, you will make decisions involving groups of ten participants from this session.</p>

<p>
  Your decisions are related to the following question:<br>
  <strong>{{ topic }}</strong>
</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled ms-2">
  <li><strong>Response A:</strong> {{ left }}</li>
  <li><strong>Response B:</strong> {{ right }}</li>
</ul>


<!-- Treatment description -->
<p>
   All participants in the session previously responded to the question. We will randomly draw a participant from groups of ten that you will interact with in different ways. Each group has the same distribution of responses on the topic, as shown in the illustration below.
</p>

<!-- PNG illustration -->
<div class="text-center my-4">
    <img src="{% static treatment_png %}"
         alt="Treatment diagram {{ treatment_png }}"
         class="img-fluid"
         style="max-width: 420px;">
</div>

<p>
    Each letter represents a participant who responded either A or B. In this group, <strong>{{ n_A }}</strong> chose A and <strong>{{ n_B }}</strong> chose B.
</p>

<p>
  When they make their decisions, participants you interact with receive the same information about who they might interact with: they are told they will interact with a randomly drawn participant from a group of ten with <strong>{{ n_A }}</strong> A and <strong>{{ n_B }}</strong> B.
</p>

<p>
  You will be put into groups of ten and will be randomly drawn to interact with other participants, but when making their decision they only know the group's distribution of preferences.
