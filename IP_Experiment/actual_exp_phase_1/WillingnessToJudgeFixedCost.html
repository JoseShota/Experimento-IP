<h1>Stage 2: Decision to Pay a Cost</h1>

<p class="mb-3">
  <strong>You are in Round {{ round_number }} of {{ total_rounds }}</strong>
</p>

<p>
  You will make a decision that involves a participant randomly drawn from one of the groups of ten participants we previously formed.
</p>
<p>
  Remember that your decision is related to the following question:<br>
  <strong>{{ topic }}</strong>
</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled ms-2">
  <li><strong>Response&nbsp;A:</strong> {{ topic_left }}</li>
  <li><strong>Response&nbsp;B:</strong> {{ topic_right }}</li>
</ul>

<!-- Treatment description -->
<p>
    As you know, the group in which we randomly draw the participant has the following distribution:
</p>
<p class="mt-3">
  <img src="{% static treatment_png %}"
       alt="Group composition"
       class="img-fluid"
       style="max-width: 420px;">
</p>

<p>In this group, five chose A and five chose B.</p>
<p>
  The drawn participant also knows that they will interact with a randomly drawn participant from a group of ten with five A and five B responses. The participant will express an opinion on the topic to you. You have the option to pay a cost of x dollars to impose a 1 dollar penalty on that participant, but only if their opinion differs from your own true opinion. 
</p>
<div class="alert alert-secondary">
  <strong>Remember:</strong> You will be put into groups of ten participants, and will be randomly drawn to interact with other participants. Each participant knows only the distribution of responses in the group they interact with, not individual preferences.
</div>

<p>
  Please indicate whether you are willing to pay this cost.
