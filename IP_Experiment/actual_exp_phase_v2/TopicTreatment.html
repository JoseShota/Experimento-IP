<h1>Topic and Response Distribution</h1>

<p class="mb-3">
  You are now in <strong>Round {{ player.round_number }} of {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }}</strong>.
</p>
<p>Over the next two screens, you will make decisions involving groups of ten participants from this session.</p>

<p>
  Your decisions are related to the following question:<br>
  <strong>{{ topic }}</strong>
</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled ms-2">
  <li><strong>Response A:</strong> {{ left }}</li>
  <li><strong>Response B:</strong> {{ right }}</li>
</ul>


<!-- Treatment description -->
<p>
   All participants in the session previously responded to the question. We will randomly draw a participant from groups of ten that you will interact with in different ways. Each group has the same distribution of responses on the topic, as shown in the illustration below.
</p>
