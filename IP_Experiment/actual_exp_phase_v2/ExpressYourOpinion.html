<h1>Stage 3: Express Your Opinion</h1>

<p class="mb-3">
    <strong> You are in Round {{ player.round_number }} of {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }}</strong>
</p>

<p>
  You will make a decision that involves a participant randomly drawn from one of the groups of ten participants we previously formed.
</p>
<p>
  Remember that your decision is related to the following question:<br>
  <strong>{{ topic }}</strong>
</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled ms-2">
  <li><strong>Response&nbsp;A:</strong> {{ topic_left }}</li>
  <li><strong>Response&nbsp;B:</strong> {{ topic_right }}</li>
</ul>

<p>
    As you know, the group in which we randomly draw the participant has the following distribution:
</p>

<div class="text-center my-4">
    <img src="{% static treatment_png %}"
         alt="Treatment diagram"
         class="img-fluid"
         style="max-width: 420px;">
</div>

<p>
    In this group, five chose A and five chose B.

  
 <p>You have to decide which opinion you would express to this participant. The participant may have paid a cost of x dollars to punish you with a 1 dollar penalty, if your opinion differs from theirs.
 </p>
<hr>
<p>What opinion would you express?</p>

  <!-- show required‐field error if they didn’t pick one -->
  <div class="text-danger mb-2">
    {{ formfield_errors 'public_opinion' }}
  </div>

  <div class="form-group">
    <label>
      <input type="radio" name="public_opinion" value="{{ left }}" required>
      {{ left }}
    </label><br>
    <label>
      <input type="radio" name="public_opinion" value="{{ right }}">
      {{ right }}
    </label>
  </div>
